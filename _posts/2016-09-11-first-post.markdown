# Yet another blog?

For years, I have been doing machine learning on Linux, playing video
games, living my passions in the Silicon Valley.
And every now and then I felt I had something to share about a topic but
didn't really have the time to start a blog. 

Well, this time is over, I'm starting yet another blog!

## The obligatory mission statement

To put it simply:

> Make machine learning accessible to programmers.

That's it, that's my main goal. I know a lot of programmers,
and I noticed a recurring pattern: *maths are hard*. Indeed.

So the idea is to simplify, to try to understand and explain some 
complex machine learning processes with examples and in a language that 
programmers can understand more easily than maths (or that will at least
make the maths easier to understand) so they can join in
on the machine learning fun.

## Yes, machine learning is fun!

Machine learning in itself is a revolution in the making, like computer
science was and still is. Self-driving cars, face recognition (hi Big 
Brother), text understanding, speech synthesis (I'm sorry Dave, 
I cannot do that), AI playing games (WOPR) and the
list goes on and on. The possibilities are endless.

And I really want to use this blog to introduce the basics of some areas
of machine learning, with some simple examples to get us started.

## And more...

Like the title says, it's going to be an eclectic blog, so I'll probably
discuss other things of interest to me, Linux and Games for example, 
or the always popular philosophical topics of machine taking over, 
and so on...
