# How I started machine learning

It all started with the [Netflix prize contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) back 2007.

Netflix introduced a contest which was to predict the number of stars a user would give to a movie.
Netflix provided a database of existing ratings (user_id, movie_id, rating, date) and also the names of the movies.
That was all, you were not told the type of movie (action, romance, ...) nor the user tastes. Everything needed to 
be inferred from the ratings the user had given to the movies they watched.

This lead me to dive into machine learning, to refresh my math knowledge, to explore existing methods and new ideas.
A special mention to Simon Funk ([Try this at home!](http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html) who shared very 
early on a sparse SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) implementation (which remarkably was less than 10 lines of code)
which opened the doors to a lot of initial progress.

Following on that, I started playing with other problems such as image zooming, denoising, deconvolution,
sentiment analysis, etc... all from the angle of machine learning.

# Back to the present

Nowadays I enjoy reading new advances in machine learning, experimenting some ideas, hacking around by modifying them 
or transposing them to different problems. 
This is basically what led to the creation of this blog and to its mission.
